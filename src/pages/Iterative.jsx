                    <h2>Iterative Design Project</h2>
                    <p>In this project, my group and I researched a startup and created mockups to encompass the main goals to the startup's concept. We chose to research the startup <b><a href="https://pyrls.com/">Pyrls</a></b> which is a website and mobile app that <b>enables healthcare providers and healthcare students to more effectively prescribe, dispense, and educate patients on their prescriptions.</b></p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>In the process of creating mockups, we used the <b>iterative design process</b>. This included creating sketches, lo-fi mockups, and a hi-fi mockup before undergoing a design critique. At the design critique, we had the opportunity to <b>meet with an industry professional from Figma and received valuable feedback</b>. Based on this feedback, we improved our hi-fi mockups to create a final version of our mockups. Finally, we used a remote user testing service to test our mockups and analyzed the results.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p style={{
          marginBottom: '5rem'
        }}><b>How it relates to education:</b> This project allowed me to do work that benefited a startup who focused on better providing educational information for healthcare professionals. Additionally, by using the iterative design process, I was able to learn more about what design choices didnâ€™t resonate with users. As a result, I was able to more effectively create a prototype that allowed users to learn the most from it by taking advantage of the different features in the prototype. </p>
